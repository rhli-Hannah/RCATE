Causal Inference using GBM, Random Forests, Neural Network, and B-spline
Additive Model

An R package producing robust estimation of treatment effects by fitting
a collection of treatment and response models using the machine learning
algorithms and regression model.

The main way to install the package is by using CRANâ€™s distribution. It
can be installed from within R using typical install.packages()
mechanism.

## Installation

You can install the released version of RCATE from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("RCATE")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rhli-Hannah/RCATE")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(RCATE)

## basic example
n <- 1000; p <- 10
X <- matrix(rnorm(n*p,0,1),nrow=n,ncol=p)
tau = 6*sin(2*X[,1])+3*(X[,2]+3)*X[,3]+9*tanh(0.5*X[,4])+3*X[,5]*(2*I(X[,4]<1)-1)
p = 1/(1+exp(-X[,1]+X[,2]))
d = rbinom(n,1,p)
t = 2*d-1
y = 100+4*X[,1]+X[,2]-3*X[,3]+tau*t/2 + rnorm(n,0,1)
x_val = matrix(rnorm(200*10,0,1),nrow=200,ncol=10)
tau_val = 6*sin(2*x_val[,1])+3*(x_val[,2]+3)*x_val[,3]+9*tanh(0.5*x_val[,4])+
3*x_val[,5]*(2*I(x_val[,4]<1)-1)
# Use L1 R-learning and GBM to estimate CATE
fit <- rcate.ml(X,y,d,method='RL')
y_pred <- predict(fit,x_val)$predict
plot(tau_val,y_pred);abline(0,1)
```
